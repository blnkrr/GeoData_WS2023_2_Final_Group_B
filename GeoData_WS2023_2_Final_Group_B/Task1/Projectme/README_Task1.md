What have been done to finalize the project?


1. The data gathered.
2.The FTP connection (which provided by the lecturer) was made to get the data online.
3.the data filtered according to desired parameters
4.We needed to produce a data frame with the help of pandas library
5.To export library to_csv code has been used.(13 station)
TASK 1.2
1.For this project the libraries of geopandas and osgeo has been used.
2.By using above library we were able to filter and get the data exactly we needed.
TASK 1.3
1.To automatically download any data first we need a ftp source. After finding the url we can grabfile function to download and use our files.
TASK 1.4
1.To visualaze a data we need specific helper libraries in phyton in this project we had choose seaborn and matplotlib (they need to be used together). Since the files are zips we need to use zipfile too.
2. To use them accordingly we need to convert the files.
3. We already have the datas accordingly.
4.By using the formula given to us (Avarage tempature formula) we can have the data  and the data frame that needs to visualized afterwards. 
5. Lastly by using specific functions that have been provided by libraries we can visualize the data as final.
