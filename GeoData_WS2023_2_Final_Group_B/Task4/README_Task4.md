What have been done to finalize the project?

1. We decided to make a data visulization project on earthquakes that are happenning
2. We wanted to use also different libraries, as a result we also used the library of folium with pandas and geopandas. 
3. First we needed to find a source for project and we used USGS datas.
4.By using read function of pandas we were able to gather our datas and we believe it was more efficient than FTP grabfile function.
5. Afterwards we converted latitude and longitude to Points
6. We made a dataframe with the help of geodataframe function of geopandas library.
7. Wtih the help of Foulium library we created a map. 
8.  The summary of statitistics is calculated
9. As last with the help of plot function we were able to visualze the data of Earthquake magnitudes.
